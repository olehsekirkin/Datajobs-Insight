# datajobs-insight
Exploring and visualizing insights in the data jobs market

# Description and getting started 
In this adventure that is learning a new skill I am trying to perfect the master of what I've found out is useful for data analysis, so this project is all about data. Libraries about data, a dataset about data jobs, graphics about data. Everything about it.

Thanks to a dataset called "Jobs and Salaries in Data Science" created by Hummaam Qaasim and uploaded to Kaggle, I got to apply some of my knowledge about the NumPy, Pandas and MatPlotLib libraries: datajobs.py being mostly directed towards the graphic design aspect of these three libraries and the other two (numpypandas and morepandas) being the ones where I mostly applied my know-how about Pandas. 

From salary distributions and job categories breakdowns to information about geographical distribution, in this project I applied a graphical representation to any useful information I could find within this dataset.

# What I Learned
I expanded what I know and started to master the libraries NumPy, Pandas and MatPlotLib.

# What's next
MatPlotLib graphs maybe require some love, they are explanatory but not so beauty as they are shown right now, still working on it.
